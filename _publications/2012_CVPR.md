### Abstract
Although surveillance video cameras are now widely used, their effectiveness is questionable. Here, we focus on the challenging task of monitoring crowded events for outbreaks of violence. Such scenes require a human surveyor to monitor multiple video screens, presenting crowds of people in a constantly changing sea of activity, and to identify signs of breaking violence early enough to alert help. With this in mind, we propose the following contributions: (1) We describe a novel approach to real-time detection of breaking violence in crowded scenes. Our method considers statistics of how flow-vector magnitudes change over time. These statistics, collected for short frame sequences, are represented using the VIolent Flows (ViF) descriptor. ViF descriptors are then classified as either violent or non-violent using linear SVM. (2) We present a unique data set of realworld surveillance videos, along with standard benchmarks designed to test both violent/non-violent classification, as well as real-time detection accuracy. Finally, (3) we provide empirical tests, comparing our method to state-of-theart techniques, and demonstrating its effectiveness.
