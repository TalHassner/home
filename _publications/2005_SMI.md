### Abstract
Constructing new, complex models is often done by re-using parts of existing models, typically by applying a sequence of segmentation, alignment and   composition operations. Segmentation, either manual or automatic, is rarely adequate for this task, since it is applied to each model independently, leaving it to the user to trim the models and determine where to connect them. In this paper we propose a new composition tool. Our tool obtains as input two models, aligned either manually or automatically, and a small set of constraints indicating which portions of the two models should be preserved in the final output. It then automatically negotiates the best location to connect the models, trimming and stitching them as required to produce a seamless result. We offer a method based on the graph theoretic minimal cut as a means of implementing this new tool. We describe a system intended for both expert and novice users, allowing easy and flexible control over the composition result. In addition, we show our method to be well suited for a variety of model processing applications such as model  repair, hole filling, and piecewise rigid deformations.

**A typical composition session**. The stages involved in creating the centaur model from those of a man and horse. (I) Input. (II) Placement (semi-automatic, using our novel part-in-whole alignment method, or manual). (III) Constraint selection (manual). (IV)  transition volume selection (manual or taking the bounding box of the union as a default selection). (V) The recovered transition surface (automatic). (VI) Clipped models (automatic). <br/>
