### Abstract
We propose a novel meta-analysis to study the relationship between properties of
task sequences and the performance of continual learning algorithms. Our analysis
makes use of recent developments in task space modeling as well as correlation
analysis to specify and analyze the properties we are interested in. As a case
study, we apply our meta-analysis to study two properties of a task sequence: total
complexity and sequential heterogeneity. The findings from our analysis suggest
directions for improving continual learning benchmarks and methods.
