<br/><b>Frontalized faces.</b> Top: Input photos; bottom: our frontalizations, obtained without estimating 3D facial shapes.

### Abstract
“Frontalization” is the process of synthesizing frontal facing views of faces appearing in single unconstrained photos. Recent reports have suggested that this process may substantially boost the performance of face recognition systems. This, by transforming the challenging problem of recognizing faces viewed from unconstrained viewpoints to the easier problem of recognizing faces in constrained, forward facing poses. Previous frontalization methods did this by attempting to approximate 3D facial shapes for each query image. We observe that 3D face shape estimation from unconstrained photos may be a harder problem than frontalization and can potentially introduce facial misalignments. Instead, we explore the simpler approach of using a single, unmodified, 3D surface as an approximation to the shape of all input faces. We show that this leads to a straightforward, efficient and easy to implement method for frontalization. More importantly, it produces aesthetic new frontal views and is surprisingly effective when used for face recognition and gender estimation.

### Downloads
  1. <b>Frontalization code:</b> Our MATLAB implementation of the method described in the paper is available on the FTP in the file frontalization.0.1.3.zip. Please see the [README.txt](../projects/frontalize/README.txt) for details on how to install and run the code. Though our code is written entirely in MATLAB, it has a few dependencies, including the [calib function](../projects/poses/project.html) and a facial feature detector. See the README.txt for further details.
The <b>entire frontalization project</b> was independently <b>ported to Python</b> by [Douglas Souza](mailto:douglas.souza.002@acad.pucrs.br). This useful port is available directly from his [github page](https://github.com/dougsouza/face-frontalization). This port uses the [DLIB facial feature detector](http://blog.dlib.net/2014/08/real-time-face-pose-estimation.html). <b>Thank you Douglas!</b>
[Yuval Nirkin](https://github.com/YuvalNirkin) has provided a [MATLAB wrapper for the DLIB face and facial landmark detector](https://github.com/YuvalNirkin/find_face_landmarks) used with the frontalization code. <b>Thank you, Yuval! </b>

2. <b>LFW3D:</b> The entire [LFW collection](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/), frontalized and stored in the same directory structure as the original LFW, is available on the FTP in the file LFW3D.0.1.1.zip.  

3. <b>Adience3D:</b> The entire [Adience image collection](../projects/Adience/Adience-data.html#agegender), frontalized and stored in the same directory structure as the original Adience collection, is available on the FTP in the file Adience3D.0.1.1.zip.
Images in the above sets were frontalized using the SDM facial feature detector ([Intraface](http://www.humansensing.cs.cmu.edu/intraface/)). Though we have found SDM to provide the best results, alternative detectors can easily be used with our code in its stead and we offer a number of other options. Please see documentation in the [README.txt](../projects/frontalize/README.txt) and the MATLAB functions themselves. 

Note that we are continuing to improve the quality of the frontalized images, and may post updates to both these collections (hence the version numbers on both files).

### What's New
- <b>6-June-2017</b>
Please see our [followup project on face recognition](./2016_ECCV_1), with more details on rendering and new Python code supporting more rendered views.

- <b>21-March-2016</b>
To help run frontalization on MATLAB, [Yuval Nirkin](https://github.com/YuvalNirkin) has provided a [MATLAB MEX for detecting faces and facial landmarks](https://github.com/YuvalNirkin/find_face_landmarks) using the DLIB library.

- <b>21-March-2016</b>
Added [a link](https://github.com/dougsouza/face-frontalization) to Python port of the frontalization project, contributed by [Douglas Souza](douglas.souza.002@acad.pucrs.br). 

- <b>8-December-2015</b>
Demo now allows for frontalization with any standard sparse (five-point) landmark detection method such as the one described in our recent paper [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04031). Choosing this option in demo.m currently allows for manual five-point localization. 

- <b>18-May-2015</b>
frontalization.0.1.2 now includes example usage with the [DLIB facial feature detector](http://blog.dlib.net/2014/08/real-time-face-pose-estimation.html) (based on [Kazemi and Sullivan](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2014/papers/Kazemi_One_Millisecond_Face_2014_CVPR_paper.pdf), CVPR'14). We have found it to provide excellent performance, and so offer it as an alternative to the commercial [SDM detector](http://www.humansensing.cs.cmu.edu/intraface/download_functions_matlab.html) and the older detector by [Zhu and Ramanan](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~xzhu/face/).
