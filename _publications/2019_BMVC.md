### Abstract
We propose a method for specializing deep detectors and trackers to restricted settings. Our approach is designed with the following goals in mind: (a) Improving accuracy in restricted domains; (b) preventing overfitting to new domains and forgetting of generalized capabilities; (c) aggressive model compression and acceleration. To this end, we propose a novel loss that balances compression and acceleration of a deep learning model vs. loss of generalization capabilities. We apply our method to the existing tracker and detector models. We report detection results on the VIRAT and CAVIAR data sets. These results show our method to offer unprecedented compression rates along with improved detection. We apply our loss for tracker compression at test time, as it processes each video. Our tests on the OTB2015 benchmark show that applying compression during test time actually improves tracking performance.
