Examples of 3D models from the google 3D warehouse, rendered in MATLAB along with their (inverse) depth-maps, using the MATLAB 3D renderer.

### Abstract
The same scene can be depicted by multiple visual-media. For example, the same event can be captured by a comic image or a movie frame; the same object can be represented by a photograph or by a 3D computer graphics model. In order to extract the visual analogies that are at the heart of cross media analysis, spatial matching is required. This matching is commonly achieved by extracting key-points, and scoring multiple, randomly generated mapping hypotheses. The more consensus a hypothesis can draw, the higher its score. 
In this paper we go beyond the conventional setsize measure for the quality of a match and present a more general hypothesis score that attempts to reflect how likely is each hypothesized transformation to be the correct one for the matching task at hand. This is achieved by considering additional, contextual cues for the relevance of a hypothesized transformation. This context changes from one matching task to another and reflects different properties of the match, beyond the size of a consensus set. We demonstrate that by learning how to correctly score each hypothesis based on these features we are able to deal much more robustly with the challenges required to allow cross media analysis, leading to correct matches where conventional methods fail.

### MATLAB 3D Model Renderer - What is this?
MATLAB function for rendering textured 3D models and computing object 6dof pose

MATLAB functions which use [OpenSceneGraph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/) and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) for the following:
- Reading standard 3D CG file formats into MATLAB (.wrl, .obj, .3ds, etc.)
- Rendering with camera control using sphere orientation (elevation , azimuth, and yaw) or camera matrix
- Results rendered <u>off-screen</u> and returned as MATLAB matrices. It is therefore suitable for console versions of MATLAB, as well as batch processing of many views / models
- Outputs depth map (inverse depth at each pixel) along with rendered views; can be used with the MATLAB 'surf' function.
- Outputs an 'unproject' matrix, linking each pixel with the coordinates the 3D surface point projected onto that pixel; it is therefore ideal for calibration / pose estimation using a 3D model as reference.
- Along with the 'calib' function, can be used to compute pose from 2D-3D correspondences, and pose-adjust models to images (see below)
3D model caching - repeated rendering of the same model automatically use cached data and do not involve re-loading / reading the CG file

### Example Usage
See quickstart section in [READMErenderer.txt](../projects/poses/READMErenderer.txt) for installation instructions. In case of any problems, please see the FAQ, also in [READMErenderer.txt](../projects/poses/READMErenderer.txt). 

Example taken from [Hassner, ICCV'13](./2013_ICCV): Rendering a 3D face model to match the pose of a face appearing in a query photo. Assuming that the code from www.ics.uci.edu/~xzhu/face/ is used for detecting facial features, and a textured 3D model of a face saved as file 'ref_model.obj'.

y1 = ref_bs.xy(:,2);<br/>
x2 = ref_bs.xy(:,3);<br/>
y2 = ref_bs.xy(:,4);<br/>
ref_XY = [(x1+x2)/2,(y1+y2)/2];
</font>

<br/><b>get 3D coordinates of facial features, using the refU map from image 2D to model 3D</b><br/>
<font face="Courier" size="2">

tmp = refU(:,:,1);<br/>
threedee(:,1) = tmp(ind);<br/>
tmp = refU(:,:,2);<br/>
threedee(:,2) = tmp(ind);<br/>
tmp = refU(:,:,3);<br/>
threedee(:,3) = tmp(ind);<br/>
% a bit of sanity<br/>
indbad = find(max(threedee,[],2)==0);<br/>
threedee(indbad,:)=[];<br/><br/>
  </font>

<b><u>STEP 2 - LOAD QUERY IMAGE, DETECT ITS FACIAL FEATURES</u></b><br/>
<font face="Courier" size="2">
queryI = imread(filen);<br/>
img_bs = detect(queryI, model, model.thresh);<br/>
img_bs = clipboxes(queryI, img_bs);<br/>

x1 = img_bs.xy(:,1);<br/>
y1 = img_bs.xy(:,2);<br/>

y2 = img_bs.xy(:,4);<br/>
img_XY = [(x1+x2)/2,(y1+y2)/2];<br/>

<b><u>STEP 3 - COMPUTE POSE USING REFERENCE 3D POINTS + QUERY 2D POINTS, AND RE-RENDER</u></b><br/>

<br/><b>re-render reference to the same pose as query.</b> Note the change in input and output parameters vs. the previous call. Also note that the model file is not reloaded and a cached version is used instead.<br/>
<font face="Courier" size="2">

<b>Illustrating the example code above.</b> Using a reference 3D model from the USF. DARPA Human-ID 3D Face Database. Detected features on the query image (red points), are matched to the same detections on the reference image (yellow points). The 'unproject' matrix refU is then used to provide each 2D point on the reference image, its corresponding 3D point on the 3D reference model, in the model coordinate system. From these 2D-3D correspondences, a camera matrix is obtained and renderer used again to render a pose adjusted reference image and corresponding depth map.
