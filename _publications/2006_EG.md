### Abstract
We present a system for automatically generating custom, structured image-maps for input depth-maps. Our system thus allows quick fitting of masses of objects with tailor-made image-maps. Given a depth-map of a novel 3D object, our method tiles it with intensities from similar, pre-collected, textured objects. These are seamlessly merged to form the new image-map. This process is performed by optimizing a well defined target likelihood function, via a hard-EM procedure. We present results for varied object classes including human figures, and fish.

### Some Results
<img src='../projects/Coloralization/results1.jpg'><br/>
<b>Fish image-maps.</b> Top row, input depth-maps; bottom row, our output image-maps<br/><br/>

<b>Human image-maps.</b> Three human figure results. Using a single DB object, our method effectively morphs the DB image, automatically fitting it to the input depthâ€™s 3D features. For each result, displayed from left to right, are the input depth, depth textured with automatically selected DB image-map (in red, depth areas not covered by the DB map,) and our result.
