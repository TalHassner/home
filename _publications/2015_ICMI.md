**Figure 1.** Image intensities (left) are converted to Local Binary Pattern (LBP) codes (middle), shown here as grayscale values. We propose to map these values to a 3D metric space (right) in order to use them as input for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. 3D codes in the right image are visualized as RGB colors.

Abstract
------
We present a novel method for classifying emotions from static facial images. Our approach leverages on the recent success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on face recognition problems. Unlike the settings often assumed there, far less labeled data is typically available for training emotion classification systems. Our method is therefore designed with the goal of simplifying the problem domain by removing confounding factors from the input images, with an emphasis on image illumination variations. This, in an effort to reduce the amount of data required to effectively train deep CNN models. To this end, we propose novel transformations of image intensities to 3D spaces, designed to be invariant to monotonic photometric transformations. These are applied to CASIA Webface images which are then used to train an ensemble of multiple architecture CNNs on multiple representations. Each model is then fine-tuned with limited emotion labeled training data to obtain final classification models. Our method was tested on the Emotion Recognition in the Wild Challenge (EmotiW 2015), Static Facial Expression Recognition sub-challenge (SFEW) and shown to provide a substantial, 15.36% improvement over baseline results (40% gain in performance)\*.

\* These results were obtained without training on any benchmark for emotion recognition other than the EmotiW'15 challenge benchmark. To our knowledge, to date, these are the highest results obtained under such circumstances.
