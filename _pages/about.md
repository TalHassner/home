I am an Applied Research Lead at Facebook AI. Before that, I was a Principal Scientist at Amazon AWS. I am also affiliated with The Open University of Israel, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science where I was an associate professor until 2018. From 2015 to 2018, I was a senior computer scientist at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) and a Visiting Associate Professor at the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems, Viterbi School of Engineering, both at USC, CA, USA, working on the IARPA Janus face recognition project.

My work is mostly related to <b>Computer Vision</b> and <b>Machine Learning</b>. Much of my work relates to <b>digital face processing</b>, including <b>face recognition</b>, facial attribute prediction, face alignment, and 3D reconstruction of face shapes. I also worked on problems related to <b>text image processing (OCR), human action recognition in videos, dense correspondence estimation, feature representation and matching</b>, and more.

I am currently an Associate editor for IEEE [Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence](https://www.computer.org/web/tpami) (IEEE-TPAMI) and IEEE [Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science](http://tbiom.ieee-biometrics.org/index.html) (T-BIOM). I was also an Associate editor for Springer [The Visual Computer Journal](https://link.springer.com/journal/371) (TVCJ),

Program co-Chair for the [IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision](http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/home) (ICCV), Montreal, CA, 2021, and the [IEEE Winter Conf. on Applications of Computer Vision](http://wacv18.wacv.net/) (WACV), Lake Tahoe, NV/CA, USA, 2018.
