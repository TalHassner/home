* <img src='../images/New - Icon.jpg' width='50'> **[<font color="SkyBlue">A collection of 100, trained Genenerative models</font>](https://github.com/vishal3477/Reverse_Engineering_GMs)**<br/> used in the project [<font color="SkyBlue">Reverse Engineering of Generative Models: Inferring Model Hyperparameters from Generated Images</font>](https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2023_TPAMI_2).


* <img src='../images/New - Icon.jpg' width='50'> Proactive Image Manipulation Detection **[<font color='SkyBlue'>Data and models</font>](https://github.com/vishal3477/proactive_IMD)**<br/>. For more information, [<font color="SkyBlue">please see our CVPR'22 paper</font>](https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2022_CVPR_1).


* **[<font color='SkyBlue'>IMGUR5K Handwriting Dataset</font>](https://github.com/facebookresearch/IMGUR5K-Handwriting-Dataset)**<br/>
We provide a unique new data set for handwritten OCR and text image manipulation. Imgur5K offers around 135K annotated, handwritten English words from 5K images originally hosted publicly on Imgur.com. Please see [<font color="SkyBlue">our TPAMI'23 paper</font>](https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2023_TPAMI) for more information.



* **[<font color='SkyBlue'>The TextOCR data set</font>](https://textvqa.org/textocr)**<br/>
We offer ~ 1M high quality word annotations on TextVQA images allowing application of end-to-end reasoning on downstream tasks such as visual question answering or image captioning. Please see [<font color="SkyBlue">our CVPR'21 preprint</font>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05486) for more information.


* **[<font color='SkyBlue'>6DoF Pose annotations for our img2pose project</font>](https://github.com/vitoralbiero/img2pose)**<br/>
We provide 6DoF face pose annotations for faces in the WIDER FACE data set. These were used for training and evaluating our img2pose: direct 6DoF pose estimation without face detection or landmark localization. For more information [<font color="SkyBlue">please see our CVPR'21 paper</font>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07791).

* **[<font color='SkyBlue'>SKU-110K data set and benchmark</font>](https://github.com/eg4000/SKU110K_CVPR19)**<br/>
Dataset for our [<font color='SkyBlue'>CVPR2019 paper</font>](https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2019_CVPR), <i>Precise Detection in Densely Packed Scenes</i>. The benchmark measures object detection scenes where images contain many objects, often appearing similar or even identical, positioned in close proximity. The 11,762 images in SKU-110k represent retail environments and average 147.4 bounding box-labeled objects (store shelf items) per image.

* **[<font color='SkyBlue'>LFW3D</font>](../publication/2015_CVPR_1)**<br/>
Frontal facing, strongly aligned [LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) images generated using our frontalization method.

* **[<font color='SkyBlue'>Unfiltered Faces for Gender and Age Classification</font>]({{ base_path }}/projects/Adience/Adience-data.html)**<br/>
Dataset of face images, labeled for age, gender and identity, acquired by smart-phones and other mobile devices, and uploaded without manual filtering to online image repositories.

* **[<font color='SkyBlue'>Dynamic Point-Cloud Data</font>](../publication/2013_PG)**<br/>
Real scans and synthetic data For foreground / background motion segmentation.

* **[<font color='SkyBlue'>Violent Flows Benchmark</font>]({{ base_path }}/projects/violentflows/index.html)**<br/>
Video benchmark for classification and detection of outbursts of violence in crowded scenes.

* **[<font color='SkyBlue'>Action Similarity Labeling Benchmark (ASLAN)</font>]({{ base_path }}/projects/ASLAN/ASLAN-main.html)**<br/>
Video benchmark for same/not-same classification of pairs of videos presenting human action in captured in the wild (YouTube).

* **[<font color='SkyBlue'>YouTube Faces Benchmark</font>](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/)**<br/>
Video benchmark for same/not-same classification of pairs of videos presenting human faces. Modeled after the LFW benchmark.

* **[<font color='SkyBlue'>LFW-a Data Set</font>]({{ base_path }}/projects/lfwa/index.html)**<br/>
Our own version of the LFW data set, aligned using commercial software.
